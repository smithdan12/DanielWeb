									<h2>Work</h2>
									<p>Simplifying Data<br />
									Demystifying Programing</p>
								</header>
								<p>Working as an analytics and reporting associate I was tasked with taking large sets of data and compacting and simplifying them down into presentations to be disseminated to the company. I would use Alteryx and SQL to pull the data, R scripts to sort the data, and Tableau to present the data. The knowledge I have with all of these tools allows me to streamline complex data projects.</p>
								<p>Working as a business support analysis at Wells Fargo, I had the opportunity to create pricing strategy algorithms. Using tools such as Python, Java, and SQL, I was able to combine fiscal policy with programming to create an algorithm that is a key part for the home mortgage loan pricing strategies. </p>

										<h2>About</h2>
										<p>Constantly Thinking<br />
									Constantly Questioning</p>
									</header>
									<p>One of my greatest skills that I possess is the ability to think critically. I try to spend time each and every day thinking about problems that may occur, or items I would like to fix. This strength has taught me how to better evaluate complex problems in both my personal and work life.</p>
									<p>I live my life never not wanting to know the answer to any questions life throughs my way. My innate desire to answer the many questions in life has led me to being someone who has a strong desire to always learn. I never want or plan to stop learning and gaining more information. </p>

									BS Economics & BS Statistics</p>

								<p>As a graduate of Purdue University, I have learned what is truly means to be a Boilermaker. Having graduated with two Bachelor of Science Degrees in Economics and Statistics I have a large amount of experience and knowledge.</p>
								<p>In addition to my major, I have taken numerous classes in both mathematics and computer science to help myself become a more well-rounded educational student. Having the ability to leverage my economics, statistics, computer science and mathematics knowledge, I feel I can help to simplify complex real-world problems.</p>

									<p>Giving back to others and seeing the development in people really provides me with a sense of worth and accomplishment. Having had the ability to work as debate coach for 3 years and give back to an organization that means so much to me has really been a highlight of my college experience.</p>
									<p>As a coach I have had the amazing change to lead my students to both personal and team state championships in my tenure. While I donâ€™t take credit for all of the awards, I am incredibly proud and blessed to have had the opportunity to serve my community in this unique way.</p>
